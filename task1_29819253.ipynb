We investigate animal communication systems, with particular emphasis on how signals are produced, transmitted and received, their information content and how they are sometimes used in social manipulation. We then go on to explore the way in which behaviour develops during the animal\\'s early life and the various influences that shape this development before moving on to examine the genetic regulation of behaviour, how behaviour evolves and how we can use comparative methods to study this process. The rest of the unit is then devoted to behavioural ecology which deals with the role of behaviour in the animal\\'s interactions with its environment and the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour on an evolutionary time scale. Topics covered in this area include foraging and anti-predator behaviour, social organisation, mating systems and parental care.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On completion of this unit students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Describe the mechanisms underlying animal behaviour;</li>\\n<li>Explain how behaviour develops and why it is adaptive;</li>\\n<li>Evaluate the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour;</li>\\n<li>Design, conduct and analyse the results of an extended research project;</li>\\n<li>Communicate findings to a scientific and a general audience in individual and group settings.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Examination (2 hours): 50%</p>\\n<p>Project outline: 5%</p>\\n<p>Project report: 35%</p>\\n<p>Group poster presentation: 10%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Two 1-hour lectures and 3 hours practical work per week</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">This unit applies to the following area(s) of study</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/ecology-and-conservation-biology\">Ecology and conservation biology</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/zoology\">Zoology</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n',\n",

The unit will commence with an introductory lecture drilling into the philosophy and theoretical justifications for copyright. The remainder of the classes will take the form of seminars, with each focusing on a specific copyright issue of global or national significance. Readings will present the often diametrically opposed views of the various stakeholders, and guest speakers will provide additional richness of viewpoint.</p>\\n<p>The curriculum will change as new issues emerge, but topics may include:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Large-scale copyright infringement. Why do people engage in copyright infringement? What is the real impact of infringement on rightholders? What are some of the possible regulatory and non-regulatory responses to the challenge posed by digital distribution technologies?</li>\\n<li>Graduated Response. What is the case for requiring ISPs to act as copyright police over their users? When should they be held liable for their users\\' infringements? How effective are the schemes in operation to date? What are the Australian proposals for reform and who do they benefit?</li>\\n<li>Copyright exceptions. How do Australia\\'s exceptions stack up internationally? What should we be trying to achieve with them, and are we succeeding in doing so? Questions might include - should we introduce a remix/mashup/transformative work exception for creators? Should we have a broadcast timeshifting exception, and if so, what should it look like? What\\'s the case for and against the adoption of \\'fair use\\'?</li>\\n<li>Orphan works. What is the orphan works problem? What causes it? How might the law be reformed to better promote the dissemination of knowledge? What are the international obstacles to reform?</li>\\n<li>Regulation of online copyright infringement. Examine international agreements such as ACTA and the TPP, and domestic bills like SOPA/PIPA and consider a. the problems they were attempting to fix, b. the reasons why they failed, and c. other potential reforms that might achieve those aims.</li>\\n<li>Recognising and rewarding authors. How good is copyright at making sure authors get paid? What are the particular challenges faced by authors and how are they evolving? Are there alternative ways of allocating rights and responsibilities that would achieve better outcomes for authors? Does the existing moral rights regime adequately protect creators\\' non-economic interests in their works?</li>\\n<li>Anti-circumvention. Why do we have anti-circumvention laws, and what are their implications for the future? Are they appropriately tailored to the challenges posed by digital distribution? Should they permit activities such as the \"jailbreaking\" of consumer electronics devices?</li>\\n<li>Protection of factual compilations and computer-generated works. What exactly is the current law in Australia, Europe and the US? What are the options for reform? How should the copyright law protect compilations of facts and computer-generated works, if at all?</li>\\n<li>Rethinking copyright. If we were able to draft a copyright law from scratch, from the ground up, what might it look like? Which of these reforms would be permitted under our existing and proposed international obligations?</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon completion of this unit students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Identify, evaluate and synthesise relevant legal and policy issues in relation to global copyright law;</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate cognitive and creative skills in analyzing complex issues pertaining to domestic and international copyright law;</li>\\n<li>Critically evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and likely effectiveness of various proposals against copyright\\'s theoretical rationales;</li>\\n<li>Communicate and advocate effectively and persuasively, both orally and in writing, on issues relating to copyright policy;</li>\\n<li>Reflect on and assess their own performance, including by taking into account feedback on earlier work, to improve their capabilities and understanding.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Three short position papers during semester (1000 words each, 3 x 20%): 60%</p>\\n<p>Seminar presentations of position papers (3 x 10%): 30%</p>\\n<p>General class participation: 10%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>(Class contact) 36 hours per week, per semester</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n',\n",

They are also expected to account for how they are responding to these risks. But what does this mean in practice? What are human rights and why are they relevant to business? What is the scope of the corporate responsibility to respect human rights? How does a business identify and manage its human rights risks and exposures? This course examines the challenges that face transnational businesses with respect to human rights, and public and private regulatory responses. It explores a diverse range of issues such as labour rights in manufacturing and food supply chains; freedom of expression, privacy and information and communication technology companies; community rights and extractive companies, and the human rights risks for lending in the financial sector.</p>\\n<p>The unit begins by introducing students to key concepts, debates and actors in the evolving field of business and human rights. It then examines the diverse regulatory mechanisms and initiatives that seek to promote corporate responsibility for adverse impacts on human rights, including national and international law, intergovernmental initiatives, multi-stakeholder initiatives and self-regulation. The unit investigates the nature and limitations of these various approaches through the use of case studies, drawn from a range of different industries and geographical localities. It also seeks to develop students\\' awareness of some of the practical challenges that business practitioners face when seeking to implement a human rights agenda within an organisational environment. While global in its scope, this unit places a particular emphasis on business and human rights in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>The learning goals associated with this unit are to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>understand the key concepts and debates in relation to corporate accountability and human rights.</li>\\n<li>identify and describe key public and private regulatory frameworks and initiatives in this area, how they interact and their strengths and limitations</li>\\n<li>understand the diversity of regulatory actors that shape the business and human rights agenda</li>\\n<li>understand the various legal and extra-legal ways in which a remedy for business-related human rights harms is pursued</li>\\n<li>engage with practical challenges that businesses may face when seeking to act responsibly and in a manner respectful of human rights.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

It focuses on a number of powerful individuals, especially Julius Caesar and the emperors Augustus, Claudius, Nero, and Hadrian, as well as the court that grew up around them-rivals, wives, freed slaves, bodyguards, and the sometimes resentful members of the Roman elite. Themes include the nature of the Roman political system and the role of the emperor, the literature and material culture of the imperial state, the rise to power of the Praetorian Guard and imperial freedmen, and the realities of Roman rule in the provinces of the empire. We take as case studies the Roman provinces of Britannia and Judea, examining the events and context of the bloody revolts against Roman power-Boudicca\\'s revolt in Britannia and the Revolt of 66 and Bar Kokhba\\'s Revolt in Judea-and their effects on provincial life and imperial Rome.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>identify and understand the Roman political ideas of government and the manner in which these were used and manipulated by those seeking power;</li>\\n<li>describe the political, social, and cultural history of Roman during the period covered;</li>\\n<li>examine the evidence relating to the role of the emperor and how the manner and impact of the imperial position was shaped by the individual personality of the incumbent, and the response from across the Roman social spectrum, from aristocrats to rural poor, freed slaves, and provincial subjects;</li>\\n<li>evaluate cultural, political, military, religious, and archaeological aspects of life in the imperial provinces, especially in Britannia and Judea;</li>\\n<li>analyse and approach critically the variety of ancient (documentary, archaeological, and literary) and modern sources, in particular through the development of skills in source criticism;</li>\\n<li>collaborate and defend interpretations and arguments concerning the Roman Empire through group tutorial presentations and individual research.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

At the same time, corporations rely for their existence on humans, and ideally should provide benefits to human lives. The central questions of this unit examine this problem: in a world defined by human relationships, how do corporations figure in social activity? Relying on anthropological analysis of corporate activity in western and non-western settings, the unit examines what corporations mean for human sociability, focussing on: the differing forms and meanings of corporations across cultures; the changing relations between humans and corporations, and their implications for understandings of human subjectivity; debates about what kinds of responsibility can be attributed to these non-human entities; different forms of speech and language used by corporations; how corporations benefit from ethnographic analysis; the ways in which social facts such as kinship and gender shape and are shaped by corporations. Drawing on ethnographic case studies as well as anthropological theorising, the unit approaches corporations not as givens, but as social products that can be compared to other cultural forms.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>explain and communicate the methods of investigation and theoretical frameworks for the anthropological study of corporations;</li>\\n<li>analyse the ethical and responsibility issues of corporations in the contemporary world;</li>\\n<li>conduct and produce an independent research project in a written form in keeping with anthropological/ethnographic convention;</li>\\n<li>develop innovative solutions to real world problems in the corporate world through applied anthropology, including a specialised awareness of the importance of human difference;</li>\\n<li>devise time management practices to manage competing demands;</li>\\n<li>engage in professional development and demonstrate a commitment to life-long learning.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Maritime security, as studied in this course, encompasses such threats as terrorism, high seas piracy and the smuggling of drugs, migrants and weapons of mass destruction. The course will also examine questions of military activities, intelligence gathering at sea and maritime environmental protest. Ninety percent of the world\\'s goods move by sea and we will cover the law governing the free movement of merchant and government ships. Marine resource management includes living resources (principally fisheries) and non-living resources (such as oil and gas).</p>\\n<p>The course will explore these issues in a manner which is historically informed and which focuses on a variety of topical case studies which may include, for example, piracy off Somali and elsewhere in the world, the South China Sea dispute, illegal fishing, whaling in the Antarctic, the emergence of deep-sea mining technology or the the controversy between Australia and Timor Leste over the management of the oil and gas in the Timor Gap.</p>\\n<p>As a major coastal State, the law of the sea touches on vital questions of Australia\\'s national interests and resource security - many of which we will explore over the semester.</p>\\n<p>Key topics will include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS);</li>\\n<li>the legal regimes of the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf;</li>\\n<li>maritime law enforcement, particularly on the high seas, with respect to piracy and transnational organised crime;</li>\\n<li>living marine resource management including fisheries management and the challenge of illegal fishing;</li>\\n<li>non-living marine resource management (including oil and gas, off-shore drilling and marine spatial planning) and the law of artificial islands and installations;</li>\\n<li>environmental protection; and</li>\\n<li>international dispute settlement and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), and the law applicable to the law of maritime boundaries and territorial demarcation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This course does not cover questions of commercial maritime law such as the carriage of goods by sea and marine insurance.</p>\\n<p>When possible, the course will be taught semi-intensively over nine weeks.  The teaching style adopted will reward attendance; it is not recommended that you take this unit if it clashes with other courses.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon completion of this unit students should be able to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>articulate and apply the international law of the sea as a body of rules to legal problems;</li>\\n<li>identify and critically discuss the content of the law of the sea with reference, inter alia, to appropriate treaty law, case law, evidence of custom and the writing of scholars;</li>\\n<li>explain the dynamic process by which the law of the sea is made and understand its place within the broader system of public international law;</li>\\n<li>analyse and critically evaluate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the law of the sea as a system for ensuring maritime security, for resource allocation and management, and for the resolution of disputes over maritime resources; and</li>\\n<li>conduct self-directed legal research.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Class participation: 10%</p>\\n<p>Reading note exercise (500): 10%</p>\\n<p>Individual or group research paper (1750 words): 35%</p>\\n<p>Take-home examination or accelerated assignment (2250 words): 45%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Scholars note that a more holistic approach to Gender Studies must take into serious consideration the meanings and relationalities between femininities and masculinities, particularly in the ways in which these synergies manifest diversely around the globe. Inspired by the insights of the celebrated masculinities scholar Raewyn Connell, this unit challenges flattened impressions of masculinity as universal, singular manifestations, and invites students to consider the unstable constructions of masculinities in relation to femininities and other intersecting issues. This eye-opening unit covers topics such as patriarchy and violence, military, spiritualities, non-heteronormative sexualities, disease, marriage, cooking, racism and female masculinities. Through a close examination of highly diverse and exciting resources, students will engage with and understand the complex and shifting performances of masculinities that impact men (and women) in Asia, Africa and the United States.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>analyse and explain key theoretical concepts of masculinities;</li>\\n<li>critique the various constructions of masculinity with their attendant (de)valorisations in Asia, Africa and the United States;</li>\\n<li>analyse the various understandings and enactments of masculinities as they are lived out in Asia, Africa and the United States;</li>\\n<li>apply key aspects of masculinity theory to critically examine relevant contemporary issues.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

It examines and develops reading, writing, thinking, communication and research skills through discipline-specific perspectives in the sciences, humanities and social sciences.  Through an exploration of basic rhetorical principles and developmental patterns of a range of academic literacy forms, emphasis is given to the discourse practices and research skills necessary for disciplinary expertise. Underpinning the development of these key skills is the recognition that   students need to be enabled to participate in academic discourses as active contributors to knowledge construction, contestation, application and communication, and not mere recipients. Lectures will focus on key areas of academic literacies while exploring differences or similarities between perspectives and genres in the various disciplines.   By engaging in the rigorous academic process of critical reading, writing, revision, presentation, and discussion together with academic support and feedback, tutorials enable students to gradually participate in the construction, debate and interrogation of academic knowledge.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Demonstrate the ability to access, evaluate, interpret and use information appropriately from a variety of sources, especially within their disciplines;</li>\\n<li>Employ skills and strategies for reading a variety of discipline-specific texts: textbooks, reports, research articles and others;</li>\\n<li>Engage in critical and reflective thinking to respond to and construct academic discourses;</li>\\n<li>Manage group dynamics and work effectively in teams to solve problems and generate desired outcomes;</li>\\n<li>Make appropriate choices regarding context, purpose, rhetoric structure, strategies, form and style to communicate effectively for different audiences and academic communities;</li>\\n<li>Revise and refine work in line with academic conventions, clarity and correctness;</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate a degree of independence and integration of skills to produce a research paper in their discipline area.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Appraise the contribution of research to the wider social work skill and knowledge base and to socially constructive outcomes.</li>\\n<li>Locate and appraise existing research literature, to guide research and practice.</li>\\n<li>Examine common approaches evident in social work research, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these to make appropriate methodological choices.</li>\\n<li>Identify the ethical issues relevant to the conduct of human research and devise appropriate strategies to manage these concerns.</li>\\n<li>Utilise professional ethical principles to balance the rights and protection of potentially vulnerable research participants.</li>\\n<li>Design a social work practice research project that is methodologically rigorous, feasible and ethical.</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate the ability to choose appropriate data analysis strategies.</li>\\n<li>Draw on a critically reflexive approach to ensure rigour and transparency in research.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Preparatory research overview  (500 words) 10%</li>\\n<li>Literature review (2500 - 3000 words) 25%</li>\\n<li>Research proposal (3500 - 4000 words) 35%</li>\\n<li>Reflective evaluation of learning and presentation (500 words) 20%</li>\\n<li>In-class exam (1000 words ) 10%</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>This unit is taught intensively, via day and distance education, over a 9 week period, beginning in Semester 2 Orientation week</li>\\n<li>As a double weighted unit, a total of 288 hours of study is expected to be completed over the semester; this will include in-class or online seminars, tutorial activities, reflective journal, weekly readings, and assignment preparation</li>\\n<li>One (1) day of on-campus attendance will be required for distance education students.</li>\\n</ul><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">This unit applies to the following area(s) of study</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/social-work\">Social work</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n',\n",

Maritime security, as studied in this course, encompasses such threats as terrorism, high seas piracy and the smuggling of drugs, migrants and weapons of mass destruction. The course will also examine questions of military activities, intelligence gathering at sea and maritime environmental protest. Ninety percent of the world\\'s goods move by sea and we will cover the law governing the free movement of merchant and government ships. Marine resource management includes living resources (principally fisheries) and non-living resources (such as oil and gas).</p>\\n<p>The course will explore these issues in a manner which is historically informed and which focuses on a variety of topical case studies which may include, for example, piracy off Somali and elsewhere in the world, the South China Sea dispute, illegal fishing, whaling in the Antarctic, the emergence of deep-sea mining technology or the the controversy between Australia and Timor Leste over the management of the oil and gas in the Timor Gap.</p>\\n<p>As a major coastal State, the law of the sea touches on vital questions of Australia\\'s national interests and resource security - many of which we will explore over the semester.</p>\\n<p>Key topics will include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS);</li>\\n<li>the legal regimes of the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf;</li>\\n<li>maritime law enforcement, particularly on the high seas, with respect to piracy and transnational organised crime;</li>\\n<li>living marine resource management including fisheries management and the challenge of illegal fishing;</li>\\n<li>non-living marine resource management (including oil and gas, off-shore drilling and marine spatial planning) and the law of artificial islands and installations;</li>\\n<li>environmental protection; and</li>\\n<li>international dispute settlement and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), and the law applicable to the law of maritime boundaries and territorial demarcation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This course does not cover questions of commercial maritime law such as the carriage of goods by sea and marine insurance.</p>\\n<p>When possible, the course will be taught semi-intensively over nine weeks.

Anthropology places human rights in broader analyses of power, politics and social inequality. Political leaders in various countries dismiss human rights as a Western concept that cannot be universalised. At the same time, tensions exist between anthropological notions of cultural plurality and relativism and the universalism inherent in dominant human rights discourse. Yet critical representatives of the discipline argue that anthropologists are ethically bound to defend human rights. This unit will explore the debates within anthropology over human rights. It will explore related notions of conflict, structural violence, peace, law and human rights activism with ethnographic examples from a range of geographic and sociocultural settings. In doing so, this unit will introduce students to key concepts and debates in the anthropology of human rights and provide fresh, rich understandings of local-global frictions and the operation of power.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>explain key concepts and debates in the anthropology of human rights;</li>\\n<li>recognise and analyse the importance, scope and distinctiveness of anthropology\\'s contribution to the analysis of power and human rights in Western and non-Western countries;</li>\\n<li>critically appraise different theoretical approaches and methodological issues from the discipline of anthropology to the study of human rights;</li>\\n<li>express complex and independent analytical and critical thinking, and produce clear, original and coherent accounts of theories, knowledge and logical argument;</li>\\n<li>apply qualitative academic research methods and skills to identify, examine and evaluate data, texts and sources to reveal patterns, themes and meanings.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

International law does not operate within a vacuum, nor does it consist of the pro forma application of abstract principles and universals detached from real world conditions. Rather, international public order is best understood as the practical regulation of a global society of state and sub-state actors, subordinate to the trans-national rule of law. International law, therefore, is inseparable from the wider issues of global governance, the mechanisms, institutions and principles that enable the global society to operate as an integrated political and legal system.</p>\\n<p>Taking this unit, students will not only acquire a sophisticated understanding of the concepts of international public order and the trans-national rule of law, but also how the integrity of the international system is inseparable from the practical operation of global governance. Understanding will be achieved through the detailed examination of a particular area of concern within international public order and how formal legal resolutions of disputes must necessarily be framed within terms of global governance and the trans-national rule of law.</p>\\n<p>The topics to be studied include: the international legal process (the concept and sources of international law); international law as the judicial basis of global governance; and practical problems in international law and world order (conflict prevention; socio-political justice; international economic law; and international environmental law).</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On completion of this unit students will have acquired or developed:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>A deeper understanding of the principles and theories of public international law and international public order.</li>\\n<li>Experience in the practical application of these principles and theories to problem solving in contemporary issues and disputes within public international law.</li>\\n<li>Further development of the skills of legal research and writing as well as oral communication.</li>\\n<li>Greater understanding of the inter-relationship between public international law, global governance, international public order and international dispute resolution.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Research paper (4000 words): 50%; seminar presentation (written): 25%; seminar presentation (oral): 10%; and class attendance and participation: 15%.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

In this unit, students examine the varied roles languages can play in multilingual societies and the relationship between language and different social identities. We explore variation within languages (e.g. regional accents) as well as variation between languages, and the ways in which school systems, workplaces and other institutions respond to language variation in their midst. A key focus of this unit is the different methods of inquiry used in sociolinguistics, and the ways in which sociolinguistic insights might be applied to real-world problems.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On successful completion of the unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>identify and apply key terms and concepts used in sociolinguistics;</li>\\n<li>reflect on their own linguistic repertoire, and how it comes to bear on their relationship with society;</li>\\n<li>apply sociolinguistic insights to their own professional context;</li>\\n<li>describe the main data gathering methods used in sociolinguistics and studies of multilingual societies, and select appropriate methods for a range of research questions;</li>\\n<li>engage in informed debate on matters of theoretical and practical significance in the areas of language and society, language education, language purism and language planning.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 288 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

It offers a journey through the social spaces of the modern city to the virtual zones of the postmodern city. By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day.

Under the supervision of their professors, and with the support of a nominated project sponsor, student teams identify a significant innovation/entrepreneurship issue for their host organisation in a high-technology sector, and combine their accumulated knowledge of management theory and consulting practice to tackle the issue. The project may have a commercial or community purpose. As an alternative to working with a host, student teams may regard MBA Labs: Technology and entrepreneurship project as an incubator and propose their own venture.

Far from value-free, medical knowledge and practice is everywhere and always embedded in a social, political, economic, and cultural context. We will probe these entwined historical experiences through an analysis of the written texts, visual sources, and material artefacts left by patients and practitioners. The focus will be on the period from the eighteenth century through to the present, when technological innovation revolutionised medical care and life expectancy increased dramatically. Topics may include: patient experiences; medical professions and professionalisation; medical technologies and epistemologies; authoritative knowledge and power in the clinic and in the laboratory; medicine and colonialism; relationship between mind and body.</p>\\n<p>Great Britain is an optimal location for a deep dive into the history of medicine. A global hub of medical history, London offers many and varied venues for exploring this topic. More than two dozen specialised museums and libraries in and around the city highlight one or more aspect(s) of the history of medicine, while numerous other collections feature fine art and material culture relevant to its study. Thanks to its prominent role in medical innovations of the Enlightenment, Edinburgh offers its own unique story accessible through local museums and libraries. For students with an interest in public history or museum studies, this is an ideal opportunity to think critically about those fields.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>explain current debates within the field of medical history;</li>\\n<li>critically assess representations of race, class and gender in medical texts, images and historical objects, and in displays at medical museums of the present;</li>\\n<li>discuss and reflect upon the ways in which historians can inform critical discussion about contemporary medical practices;</li>\\n<li>communicate research on relevant topics orally and in writing.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 288 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Writers have felt compelled to define Irish identity in response to crises, from the agitation to achieve independence from British rule, and reactions to the exertion of power by the Catholic Church, to the more recent financial collapse, and debate over reproductive rights. Under such pressures, authors innovated in diverse ways. Yeats sought a mystical system of symbols, while Beckett turned to the absurd. Joyce interrogated the possibilities of language, while Mhac an tSaoi articulated the affinity between the artist\\'s struggle with tradition and the challenges faced by women in Irish society. Heaney and Kinsella were among those who both responded to contemporary events explicitly and reached into ancient legend for material to help ascertain what type of narrative might be considered characteristically Irish. Considering this search for identity in literary forms such as poetry, drama, the short story, and the essay - and addressing receptions of this heritage in film, popular song, and graphic novels - the unit explores a century of self-definition in a culture that constitutes a significant area of literary studies, and that has a rich tradition of exchange with Australia.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>explain and critique the modern Anglo-Irish literary canon;</li>\\n<li>apply various critical perspectives on Anglo-Irish literature to a range of literary works;</li>\\n<li>examine texts in different literary forms within an evolving cultural tradition;</li>\\n<li>critically analyse fundamental Irish historical/political contexts, and how authors engaged with these;</li>\\n<li>critically read and interpret literary texts.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Students will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. Students will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and themselves undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. Students will especially be directed to thinking what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for themselves and others to put the art-historical knowledge they otherwise gain in their studies to practical use in the public arena?</p>\\n<p>Throughout the unit a number of practical exercises in writing about art will be undertaken, giving students a sense of the different requirements for different kinds of writing. Above all, they will form the habit of writing about art, and understand that writing about art is a \"practice\" just as artists have a practice. To this extent, Art Writing and Criticism must be seen as allied to the new units offered in art curation (Curating: Histories and Theories and Curating: Practices) in opening up to students studying Art History certain \"practical\" or \"vocational\" outcomes for their skills and knowledges.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Identify and analyse the different places and formats in which the discussion of art takes place;</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate practical mastery of the various genres and styles of art writing;</li>\\n<li>Apply good work habits with regard to their own \"art writing\" practice;</li>\\n<li>Develop new venues and opportunities for art writing in the 21st century;</li>\\n<li>Employ new skills in online web publishing, graphic design and layout required to self- and other-publish online and in book and magazine production.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>100% in-semester assessment</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>12 hours per week including 3 contact hours plus 9 hours of independent study, or equivalent.</p><p>See also <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/timetables/\">Unit timetable information</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n',\n",

Using a political economy approach, the unit will provide a comparative perspective on Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa also known as the BRICS. Over the past ten years the geo-political and economic importance of the BRICS has been increasing. While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face. Particular attention is given to the thematic areas of international trade, international finance, the environment, global health and food security.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>The learning goals associated with this unit are to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>explain the different theoretical perspectives on the rise of the BRICS</li>\\n<li>explain the history of the BRICS covering domestic and foreign policy perspectives</li>\\n<li>critically evaluate the influence of the BRICS in a globalising world.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

A full list of projects will be made available to students prior to commencing their MSc program.</p>\\n<p>The research project may be observational, computational or theoretical in nature, or it may involve a combination of these research paradigms. Each student will be assigned an academic supervisor (or supervisors), who will oversee the research project and provide mentoring. Students will be required to undertake a comprehensive literature review and report their preliminary results via a seminar. The major outcomes of the project will be communicated in the form of a thesis. Students will also be required to defend their research outcomes via an oral examination.  For most students their project will be continued into the second year of the MSc program; hence ASP4000 will lay the foundations for a substantial ongoing research project in the second year of the degree.</p>\\n<p>As part of their research training, students will be affiliated with one of the School\\'s research groups (aligned with their research project) and will be required to attend weekly group meetings, seminars and colloquia.

Discrete structures, such as those treated in graph theory, set theory, combinatorics and symbolic logic form the mathematical underpinning of the study of algorithms. As well-designed algorithms and data structures are essential for the good performance of an information system, an in-depth understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms is essential for any computer scientist. As importantly, the theoretical investigation of algorithms leads to a deeper understanding of problem structures and classes of problems and the knowledge of a large variety of algorithm types enables the designer to approach a new problem from different angles.

In most instances the project is to be determined by the students at the beginning of the semester in consultation with their lecturer. The outcomes of the project undertaken will vary depending upon the individual objectives established by the students and teaching staff. The unit provides an opportunity to undertake conceptual designs which will lead to the development of these ideas in the subsequent Design Projects.  Students should be particularly concerned with the development of their personal design philosophy, the way in which it responds to social needs and its visual and social expression as a preliminary to its virtuoso development in the major project. The contemporary discourse in design and related theory is actively discussed and debated, with students encouraged to develop a personal position relative to it. Both the intentions of students and the results of their work are debated in group discussions and critical sessions.

Students explore a range of theoretical underpinnings that impact upon the educational process in health care practice with emphasis placed on educational theorists. Students will apply theoretical learning to teaching practice through participation in practicum; or through their role as a teacher within their own clinical practices. This will include both classroom (small and large group) and clinical teaching experiences in a variety of settings. It will equip students with the knowledge and mastery of skills necessary to critique, understand and respond to the learning preferences and needs of those whose education they have responsibility for. It will prepare students with the skills and knowledge to critically evaluate and assess the outcomes of an educational intervention. It will offer students a theoretical underpinning for current modelling of professionalism, clinical competence and lifelong learning.</p>\\n<p>This unit is a compulsory core unit for the Master of Family Medicine (MFM) a core unit in the Education Stream for the Master of Nursing (MN) and an elective unit in the Master of Clinical Midwifery (MCM).</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Critique and reflect on the most appropriate and evidence based method(s) of assessment for a given learning experience, be able to justify their choice, and offer detailed explanations of the complexity of its implementation within a multicultural setting.</li>\\n<li>Design and critique an appropriate evaluation strategy for a given learning experience, including an assessment of the outcome(s).</li>\\n<li>Investigate and critically analyse recent ethical trends within their profession with particular reference to the teaching and assessment of clinical professionalism and competence.</li>\\n<li>Demonstrate competence as a clinical teacher (including a self and peer critical evaluation of the teaching) and the competence to reflect on and constructively respond to the results of such evaluation.</li>\\n<li>Design, critique and reflect on an appropriate tutor preparation to enable effective delivery of a given learning experience: teaching others to teach.</li>\\n<li>Critically assess and evaluate recent trends within their profession with particular reference to inter professional education.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Written assignment (critique) (2,500 words) (30%)</li>\\n<li>Practicum &amp; practicum reflective report (60 minutes) (1,000 words) (20%)</li>\\n<li>Portfolio (4,000 words) (50%)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">This unit applies to the following area(s) of study</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/nursing\">Nursing</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"../aos/nursing-education\">Nursing education</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<!-- /.content_container--> </div>\\n<!-- /.content-inner__main --></div>\\n\\n',\n",

In a liberal democracy like Australia, its role and function have profound implications for the conduct of politics, the nature of democracy and public policy outcomes. In this unit, the relationship between the media, politics and public policy is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of news media on the policy debate. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated. Particular emphasis is on the structure and operation of media organisations and journalists and how political news is covered. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and political actors. Particular emphasis is on the use of public relations and \\'spin doctors\\' in managing the media as well as the utilisation of political advertising and strategic political communication by governments and political agents.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit students should have:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>the ability to identify the relationship between the liberal democratic tradition and the mass media, and the assumptions (and tensions) that underpins this relationship;</li>\\n<li>the ability to critically analyse the relationship between political institutions and the media;</li>\\n<li>the ability to critically assess the impact of new technologies on the media and the opportunities and constraints this presents for government and public policy;</li>\\n<li>the ability to critically analyse the use and impact of media professionals on the policy debate;</li>\\n<li>the understanding of the legal and regulatory framework of the Australian media industry.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

In many materials, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites, the physical properties depend on the direction, i.e. they are anisotropic. Describing anisotropy requires proper mathematical tools, as well as an understanding of the material structure at the relevant length scale in order to quantify the property coefficients in various directions. In this unit, we introduce tensors and matrices as mathematical tools to describe anisotropic properties and calculate property relationships in different directions. Material symmetry arguments are introduced to identify the number of independent property coefficients. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are systematically investigated (elasticity, electrical permittivity, heat conduction...), including coupled effects (e.g. piezoelectricity, thermal expansion...). Practical problems involving tensor operations are solved using the Python programming language. While there is no formal prerequisite for this unit, basic knowledge in Thermodynamics and Crystallography (MTE 2541 or equivalent), Mechanics of Materials (<span class=\"unitlink\"><a href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/units/MTE2546.html\">MTE2546</a></span> or equivalent) will be highly beneficial, as well as basic programming skills (<span class=\"unitlink\"><a href=\"/pubs/2019handbooks/units/ENG1060.html\">ENG1060</a></span> or equivalent).</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Classify physical material properties (e.g. principal vs. coupled, equilibrium vs. transport).</li>\\n<li>Use tensors to describe anisotropic properties of materials and calculate properties in a specific direction.</li>\\n<li>Apply symmetry principles to determine the number of independent property coefficients and structure of the tensor needed to describe an anisotropic property.</li>\\n<li>Analyse structure-property relationships in materials with a range of different symmetries at different length scales, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites.</li>\\n<li>Use scientific computing to perform tensor operations.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Continuous assessment: 70%</p>\\n<p>Examination (2 hours): 30%</p>\\n<p>Students are required to achieve at least 45% in the total continuous assessment component and at least 45% in the final examination component and an overall mark of 50% to achieve a pass grade in the unit.

It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe\\'s crises &amp; revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato\\'s most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy\\'s First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students should be able to</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>analyse the contribution of Italian political thought to the formation and development of modern political ideologies;</li>\\n<li>explain the architecture of post-war Italy\\'s First Republic, and the emergence and development of Italy\\'s Second Republic;</li>\\n<li>discuss the recent emergence of Italian populist movements and parties and their relationship to Italian democracy, political parties and the European Union;</li>\\n<li>undertake research analysis of a major Italian contribution to contemporary theories of power and democracy, utilising primary and secondary texts and contemporary case studies.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Weeks are devoted to the close analysis of film, with topics focusing on key formal and stylistic elements, such as narrative, mise en scene, camerawork, editing and sound. In addition, students will become familiar with some of the main theoretical approaches used in Film Studies, such as authorship, genre and national cinema. Throughout the unit emphasis is placed on situating films within their broader social, political and historical contexts, and in doing so students will engage with the ideological significance of cinema - how films offer particular, politically-loaded visions of life. Exploration of these issues is supported through weekly screenings, with a variety of films being shown, spanning a range of historical periods, genres and countries.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Outcomes</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Upon successful completion of the unit, students should be able to:</p>\\n<ol princestart=\"0\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\\n<li>Analyse films with particular attention to their main formal and stylistic features;</li>\\n<li>Identify techniques used to create meaning in films;</li>\\n<li>Apply theories from Film Studies to facilitate the analysis of films;</li>\\n<li>Evaluate critical debates on cinema and on particular films;</li>\\n<li>Plan and conduct written work on how meaning is created in cinema.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Assessment</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Within semester assessment: 100%</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 class=\"hbk-heading\">Workload requirements</h2>\\n<div>\\n<p>Minimum total expected workload to achieve the learning outcomes for this unit is 144 hours per semester typically comprising a mixture of scheduled learning activities and independent study.

Radiographic knowledge will be extended to enable examinations of the respiratory system, shoulder and pelvic girdles, the vertebral column, the bony thorax and plain abdomen to be safely performed. Building on earlier principles of professional practice, RAD1012 will introduce the science required for more advanced radiographic equipment operation. Radiation dosimetry and safety is also studied so that competent operation and performance measurement of diagnostic ionising radiation equipment may be executed. Clinical exposure to patients under supervision will enable the student to apply these principles across the range of examinations indicated.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2

equipment;</li>\\n<li>Discuss the response of organ systems to ionising radiation exposure, how x-radiation is monitored and measured and how personal monitoring is used, recorded and reported to enable safe practices in radiation areas for patient, staff and the general public;</li>\\n<li>Calculate the energy content of an x-ray beam, integral dose, dose-area product and define dose and equivalent dose when x-rays are absorbed by living tissue, using correct units;</li>\\n<li>Employ the principles learnt about kV, mAs and geometry of the x-ray beam that impact upon the four image quality factors of optical density, contrast, image detail and distortion to describe the characteristics of a radiograph;</li>\\n<li>Review the theoretical principles underpinning the operation of automatic exposure systems and computed radiography systems, and where appropriate apply this in the clinical setting;</li>\\n<li>Record and obtain information from individuals employing appropriate observation and interviewing skills, such that the information generated may be integrated with basic scientific theory and knowledge to provide quality levels of patient care;</li>\\n<li>Recognise and adapt, in a professional manner, to the variety of social, cultural and ethical perspectives that may be encountered within clinical practice.</li>\\n<li>Describe and justify the radiographic projections, body positions and the radiographic technique underpinning general radiographic examinations of the of the respiratory system, shoulder and pelvic girdles, the vertebral column, the bony thorax and plain abdomen;</li>\\n<li>Position an adult patient, accounting for his/her clinical presentation, for the radiographic projections identified in the protocol, direct and align the central ray to an appropriate bony landmark, image receptor and ancillary equipment such as the bucky, grids and automatic exposure devices;</li>\\n<li>Evaluate radiographs in terms of technical quality and positioning criteria and where necessary devise appropriate problem-solving strategies for less than optimal radiographic projections;</li>\\n<li>Distinguish radiographic anatomical features and recognise associated common radiologic pathologies or traumatic appearances in terms of the clinical question being asked;</li>\\n<li>In the light of the clinical problem, assess the appropriateness of supplementary projections, and where required position the patient for the required further images;</li>\\n<li>Under supervision, safely conduct radiographic examinations of the respiratory system,

The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family\\'s values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels.
